## My Experience as a JS Newbie
<img class="ui small right floated image" src="../images/athlete.png">
I'm a complete newbie to Javascript. I'm also a bit rusty because I haven't used a proper programming language for at least a semester since I devoted most of my energy to an algorithms course last semester. Luckily, JS is intuitive enough that you can get through all the basics in less than ten hours. I think this is thanks to the fact that it shares a lot of common elements with the basics of other common programming languages (I know Java, C, and C++).

From a software engineering perspective, I would say that Javascript has its pros and cons (as with any other language), but is overwhelmingly a "good" language. For example, I enjoy the fact that Javascript doesn't use return types, which makes it much more flexible. On the other side of the coin, more flexibility might lead to more mistakes. I can see JS being "good" for a careful software engineer and "bad" for a hasty one. 

I was also fascinated by all the function shortcuts, which I'd seen no equivalent for in any other language I've learned. Overall, JS seems less strict than other languages I've used in the past (especially compared to Java), and I find it very convenient that no IDE is needed. Additionally, JSFiddle is an amazing site which I'd never before heard of but can absolutely see myself using in the future. Overall, I would say that JS feels very familiar for any newbie with some programming experience in languages like Java or C/C++.

## Does Athletic Software Engineering Work for an Unathletic Software Engineer?
### What is ASE?
The concept is to exercise our thinking by revisiting the content multiple times as a way to "train" for the assessment. Repeated exposure over the course of a few days to a week keeps our brain fresh and helps us learn more easily. From what I've seen of ICS 314 so far, the "athletic software engineering" technique employed is a very effective strategy. 

### My Experience with ASE: First Two Weeks

To me (and I'm sure many other CS majors might agree), anything remotely "athletic" can be daunting. However, I have found thus far that taking full advantage of all the practice opportunities available to me leaves me feeling confident and well-prepared for in-class assignments that make up more of my grade. Admittedly, I get stressed easily about extracurricular study opportunities (such as the Rashmi-WODs we have access to in ICS 314), but I've made a commitment to myself this semester to attend any and all study opportunities available to me outside of class. So far, it seems to be working! That repeated exposure to a certain topic makes it much easier to digest is a very intuitive concept. The hard part is just sticking to it, but it's worked for me so far.

If this technique continues to be effective, I hope to extend it to my other classes. I think it would be very helpful if I were to include it in my homework regimen and "train" myself for any subject. It's a great way to synthesize new information and start out with practice problems, which builds confidence in a given topic. I'd like to feel as confident walking into graded assignments in other classes as I did walking into my first "Work Out of the Day" (WOD) of ICS 314 after completing all the practice WODs.

Perhaps if I'd practiced ASE for any of the languages I learned before taking my algorithms class, those languages would come to my mind more readily now and not require as in-depth of a review after some time away. In any case, ASE is something I can utilize for years to come.
