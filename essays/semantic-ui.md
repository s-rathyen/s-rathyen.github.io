## Introduction
<img class="ui small right floated image" src="../images/athlete.png">
This week, in my Software Development class, we worked through a module on UI Frameworks. Specifically, we learned how to use Semantic UI (or at least some of it -- there's a lot to know). I'd never heard of UI Frameworks before, so I was intimidated by the module, especially the assignment that required us to watch 3-4 hours of tutorials on Semantic UI. However, I'm a sucker for UI! I enjoy making aesthetically pleasing, easily navigable webpages. As I mentioned in a previous essay, I have some experience with CSS/HTML, but it's mostly limited to absolute positioning over a very large background image I created in Photoshop to place text, hovers, and dropdown tabs where I wanted them to go.

## Semantic UI: The Learning Process
As you might guess from the mention of the 3-4 hours of tutorials, learning a UI Framework requires a significant upfront investment of time, and with that investment you'll only scratch the surface of proficiency with Semantic UI. But it's a very wise investment: knowing Semantic UI, or another UI Framework, will vastly improve your efficiency in building webpages using an intuitive, minimalistic approach to HTML.

## Then Vs. Now
As I mentioned, my experience with HTML/CSS is extremely painstaking. It took me hours to construct a webpage using absolute positioning and a lot of redundant code. The overwhelming benefit to Semantic UI is that it will cut the time it takes you to create a single webpage exponentially. What's amazing about Semantic UI is that it has a 'natural language' feature

Overall, what seems like a long time invested to learn about Semantic UI and all the various collections, components, and modules it has to offer pales in comparison to the time you'll save using Semantic UI to create a webpage. I've gone from taking hours to create a boring webpage that relied on photoshop graphic and absolute CSS positioning to look pretty, to taking twenty three minutes to create a clean, aesthetically pleasing mockup of a website's homepage during an in class exercise. What's even better is that I didn't have to spend three hours in photoshop making a "pretty" layout to come out the other side with a professional, gorgeous display.

## Looking Forward
For an assignment, we were also instructed to recreate a webpage of our choosing. I chose to recreate Bauer, a hockey website, at my boyfriend's suggestion, and was surprised to see how closely I could mimic it in just a couple hours. While brainstorming websites to recreate, I also considered mimicking a page for my boyfriend's dad's surfboard company (he's a surfboard shaper), but decided to use Bauer's page instead, since it was more complex (why do I do such things to myself?). What's most exciting about Semantic UI is that I can look at almost any homepage now and say, hey, I could recreate that in a couple hours! I jokingly told my boyfriend that I would be able to rebuild his dad's site once I finished this class thanks to UI Frameworks.

Even more amazingly, Semantic UI makes mobile responsiveness amazingly simple. For example, if using a menu for your page's layout, you can add in a single word to the div class, "stackable," and it will make it stack at mobile breakpoints. This feature amazed me when I learned about it! Mobile responsiveness is becoming increasingly necessary as more people access the internet from their phones, and this makes it so much easier for programmers to deliver a mobile friendly result.

The same ease of use goes for many other features: for example, if you wanted to create a black menu with white text, instead of creating multiple lines in your CSS to change the background and font color in a menu, you can add in a single word to your menu div class, "inverted," which will do all of that automatically.  

I truly believe UI Frameworks is a game changer. I'm excited to use it in the future to create gorgeous websites with much more intuitive HTML and CSS than I have made previously.
