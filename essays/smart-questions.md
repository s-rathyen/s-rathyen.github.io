## Why Ask Questions the Smart Way?
Although in many spheres of academia you might hear the maxim, "There are no stupid questions here!", that certainly doesn't apply in CS Forums online. And it's quite clear why: although you may get away with posing a "not smart" question to your professor, who is paid to answer questions (including the not-so-smart ones), you surely won't get away with posting a "not smart" question online and expecting an answer from people who are donating their time to help others.

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Instead, the goal of this exercise is to help you form a deeper understanding of what constitutes “smart” and “not smart” questions so that you are more likely to ask smart ones in the future.
