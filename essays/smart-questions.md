## Why Ask Questions the Smart Way?
Although in many spheres of academia you might hear the maxim, "There are no stupid questions here!", that certainly doesn't apply in  Programming Forums online. And it's quite clear why: although you may get away with posing a "not smart" question to your professor, who is paid to answer questions (including the not-so-smart ones), you surely won't get away with posting a "not smart" question online and expecting an answer from people who are donating their time to help others.

## How Can I Ask Smart Questions?
### Ground Rules
According to Eric Raymond's "How to ask questions the smart way," some of the qualifications of a smart question include: 
* Aim your question to the right audience. Don't insult and waste people's time by not doing your research. Make sure you're posting on a forum made to deal with your specific issue. Don't, for example, post a programming question on a vacuum repair forum.
* Be precise about the problem. You should provide all the details necessary, including but not limited to symptoms, the environment in which it occurs, the research you did to understand what went wrong, and the diagnostics you did to try to solve the problem.
* To avoid the notorious RTFM (Read the Manual) and STFW (Search the Web) answers, make sure you go through those preliminary measures -- and maybe you'll be able to solve the issue yourself along the way.
If you've successfully completed all these steps, you can go ahead and ask your question. You should be explicit in asking questions, and make sure it's not just your question that is clear and smart, but if you're posting a question on a forum, your heading should be equally clear and informative to attract the most attention you can. If you've done enough leg work, people will be more likely to answer your question.


## What About a Not-So-Smart Question?

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Instead, the goal of this exercise is to help you form a deeper understanding of what constitutes “smart” and “not smart” questions so that you are more likely to ask smart ones in the future.
