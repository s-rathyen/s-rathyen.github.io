## My Experience as a JS Newbie
Admittedly, I'm a complete newbie to Javascript. For the most part, it seems very straightforward. I find 

## Does Athletic Software Engineering Work for an Unathletic Software Engineer?
### What is ASE?
The concept is to exercise our thinking by revisiting the content multiple times as a way to "train" for the assessment. Repeated exposure over the course of a few days to a week keeps our brain fresh and helps us learn more easily. From what I've seen of ICS 314 so far, the "athletic software engineering" technique employed is a very effective strategy. 

### My Experience with ASE: First Two Weeks
To me (and I'm sure many other CS majors might agree), anything remotely "athletic" can be daunting. However, I have found thus far that taking full advantage of all the practice opportunities available to me leaves me feeling confident and well-prepared for in-class assignments that make up more of my grade. Admittedly, I get stressed easily about extracurricular study opportunities (such as the Rashmi-WODs we have access to in ICS 314), but I've made a commitment to myself this semester to attend any and all study opportunities available to me outside of class. So far, it seems to be working! That repeated exposure to a certain topic makes it much easier to digest is a very intuitive concept. The hard part is just sticking to it, but it's worked for me so far.

If this technique continues to be effective, I hope to extend it to my other classes. I think it would be very helpful if I were to include it in my homework regimen and "train" myself for all my other classes. It's a great way to synthesize new information and start out with practice problems, which allows me to work up my confidence. I'd like to feel as confident walking into graded assignments in other classes as I did walking into my first "Work Out of the Day" (WOD) after completing all the practice WODs for ICS 314.
