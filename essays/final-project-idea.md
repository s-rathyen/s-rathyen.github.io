# Project: Fitness Finder / Gym Genius
## Overview
<i>The problem:</i> The freshman fifteen! So many students enter and go through college feeling too ashamed to go to the gym alone or feeling afraid to go on a run alone because of safety concerns.<br/><br/>
<i>The solution:</i> The Fitness Finder application allows students to log in and create a profile which specifies things like their gender, interests (e.g. strength training, running, outdoors), level (e.g. just starting, intermediate), "looking for" (e.g. a mentor to help me improve, a friend to keep me company while running, spotter/gym body, n/a), and goals (e.g. run an 8 minute mile, squat 200 lbs, hike Stairway to Heaven). The app would pair the user with someone with matching/similar interests. It will also include the ability to document your meetups (for safety or progress tracking), upload photos for each completed outing, and a feed where you can see the completed meetups/workouts other users have done.
