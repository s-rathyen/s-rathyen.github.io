create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

## Past

I often don't talk about why I first became interested in software engineering because the origins of my interest are very childish. I first encountered HTML on MySpace, which I'm sure is true of many people who, like me, grew up in the infancy of social media. I learned (through my simultaneously rebellious and trendy cousin, who was obsessed both with MySpace and which eyeliner made her look the most "emo") how to doctor the layout of profiles with some very rudimentary HTML skills. I played around with fonts, with text size, and with tiling backgrounds. It was like typing magic!

Strangely enough, as I grew older, my online interests seemed to become more childish. I was constantly searching for some creative outlet where I could dump my thoughts -- mediocre unfinished stories, poems, and drawings. I wanted to exercise my left brain. I'm the child of a musician who loves to draw, and I seem to have inherited that gene for creative endeavor. Somehow, I met my perfect match in (dare I say it) a <i>virtual pet site</i>. Maybe it was my lack of a real pet (my mom would never consent), or maybe it was my reluctance to talk to people in real life... whatever it was, I wound up pouring all my creative energy into a virtual site akin to the <i>Neopets</i> I knew and loved as a child. My middle school and (early, in my defense) high school days often consisted of me spending hours making up fictional stories for my pixel pets.

Of course, all of this was completely confidential to everyone other than myself. I thought people would laugh at me for it. But looking back, I have this childish site to thank for teaching me (or should I say, inspiring me to learn) so much about HTML and CSS. It was the driving force behind my passion for learning how to set up a webpage by tinkering around with code and, later, learning how to use Photoshop to create backgrounds for those pages.

I learned enough HTML and CSS that I was able to create webpages which seemed to look nicer with every attempt. It came to the point where I was freelancing my rudimentary web design and graphic design skills for $10/piece. In retrospect, spending 4-5 hours creating a layout on photoshop then writing code to align the right text and features to the right place for no more than $2 an hour is absolutely heinous, but I was making money for something I was really passionate about, and that really taught me something. (I later increased my prices to $20, still a steal for well-designed graphics and code, but if I'm being honest with myself, there wasn't much demand in the first place.) I did make a name for myself in that niche pet site graphics community, if I can call it that.
