create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

I often don't talk about why I first became interested in software engineering because the origins of my interest are very childish. My first encounter with HTML was via MySpace, which I'm sure is true of many people who, like me, grew up in the infancy of social media. I learned (through my simultaneously rebellious and trendy cousin, who was obsessed with MySpace) how to doctor the layout of profiles with some very rudimentary HTML skills.

This was really the driving force behind my learning elementary HTML and CSS (and not to mention my interest in graphic design). I learned enough that I was able to create webpages which seemed to look nicer every time I made them, even to the point where I was freelancing those designs that I created and selling them to others for as little as $5.
