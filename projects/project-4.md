Witch Hunt! was my first foray into game development in Java. I made this game for my ICS 111 class, which was my first programming course. I thoroughly enjoyed that course (which I took as an elective in my engineering pathway), and it inspired me to change my major and pursue software development as a Computer Science student.

Witch Hunt! was challenging but fun to make and made me realize how much I enjoy game development. It also was my first experience using any kind of IDE. For ICS 111, we used Eclipse. Before entering college, I was familiar with some aspects of HTML and CSS, so Java in Eclipse was brand new for me. Now that I've had more experience with programming, I realize that it would be easy to implement WASD or arrow game controls that would make the game much less tedious to play.

Additionally, I've always had a passion for web design and web art, so I created the pixel graphics (witch, mouse, tombstones, cauldron) myself in photoshop with a tablet as well as the background image. These things made it more time-intensive than the project was probably intended to be for a programming class, but it was very exciting to see the project come together.
