summary: My first Java game.
---

Witch Hunt! was my first foray into game development in Java. I made this game for my ICS 111 class, which was my first programming course. I thoroughly enjoyed that course (which I took as an elective in my engineering pathway), and it actually inspired me to change my major and pursue software development as a Computer Science student. 

Witch Hunt! was challenging but fun to make, and made me realize how much I enjoy game development. Now that I've had a bit more experience with programming, I realize that it would be easy to implement WASD or arrow game controls that would make the game much less tedious to play.

Additionally, I've always had a passion for web design and web art, so I created the pixel graphics (witch, mouse, tombstones, cauldron) myself in photoshop with a tablet, and created the background image there as well. These things made it more time intensive than the project was probably intended to be for a programming class, but it was fun to see the result come together.
