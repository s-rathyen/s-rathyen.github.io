This was my third project for my first programming class, ICS 111. The objective of this project was to work in a small group and create some kind of program together using Java in Eclipse.

The premise of Vesuvius is that you (the player) are a water god trying to escape from an active volcano which is about to explode. 

For our group project, I was responsible for writing the functions for the program. I combined elements of my first and second game -- specifically, the multiple levels + ingredient collection from the first project and the flying fireballs + barriers in the second. I improved on the former by upgrading the ingredient collection of the potions since the potions could be used to slow the fireballs. I Improved on the barriers by creating a platform environment where you have to jump from one platform to another to avoid falling into lava (which would rise at the end of the level and had to be avoided to reach the next level). 

I learned a lot from this project. Most valuable to me was the experience of working with two of my classmates and writing different files (I wrote the functions and they wrote the main). This was the first project for which we had to separate files. It was a valuable experience because working in conjunction with others and making sure your files work properly together is an essential part of many Computer Science jobs.
